# PHP HEAD Attack

Most developers write scripts that do a certain amount of tasks and assuming that it will run completly.

Here we have a small example:

```
<?php
  //Money transfer from "a" to "b"
  $account["A"] += 100;
  echo "received 100$";
  $account["B"] -= 100;
?>
```

Normaly when running the script account "B" has 100$ less and account "A" has 100$ more in the end.

When you now perform a HEAD request, the script starts, run until the first echo, then PHP generates the header, returns it and terminates the script. That means that everytime you perform a HEAD request, account "A" gets +100$, but account "B" keeps the balance.
